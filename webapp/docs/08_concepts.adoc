== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Design patterns

In order to access and manipulate data in a clean way, the MVC pattern was the chosen one to start developing. 

This way, as it will be developed in React, it is one of the best options for accessing to the solid pods.


Once it is required, there can also be applied more design patters as needed.

=== Security
As the architecture of the application is decided, this section will be updated.

It will be a crutial part to deal with, ensuring the user secure accesses via secure https protocol, having all the time validation constraints to avoid undesirable risks.

=== Technical decisions
* Once we start making decisions about tools or functionalities, this part will be fulfilled with all of the most important ones.

=== Intenationalization
From the popular point of view of every application (and specifically for this one which deals with locations and people), it looks like as if it was mandatory to produce a well based multilanguage application, and the best option is always at the beginning of the design. 

Otherwise, during it's lifetime it would be much more expensive to trace if the app gets popular in more regions.
