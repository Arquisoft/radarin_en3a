== Cross-cutting Concepts
=== Domain model
image:usuario.png["Model"]

* User, a user is identified with its unique web id, this is the id of the users pod. We have the longitude and the latitude the location of this user, this changes frequently. We also have the role (we have a admin role and a normal user).

We have to store our user in a database (mongoDB) so our schema is very similar to the one before.
user = {
    webId: <webId of the user>,
    longitude: <coordinates of the user>,
    latitude: <coordinates of the user>,
    role: <admin/normal>
}

=== Design patterns

In order to access and manipulate data in a clean way, the MVC pattern was the chosen one to start developing. 

This way, as it will be developed in React, it is one of the best options for accessing to the solid pods.

Regarding the backend part, there will be a model to define the database skeleton (seen above) and routes to get every action. This way, a controller will orchestrate the main crud functionality apart from the ones that would be potentially required.


=== Security

It will be a crucial part to deal with, ensuring the user's secure accesses via secure https protocol, having all the time validation constraints to avoid undesirable risks.
Mainly, security is assured thanks to the solid pods in where each user has it's own individual place of safe information by using the authentication solid library.
The security is also increased because we do not store the passwords of the users that use our application in the database.
We have also security in the restapi, this is done using the CORS mechanisms. With this we ensure that the api will not be accessed in dangerous ways.
Furthermore, getting the location of the user will always be ask, so if they find that this is a security risk they can avoid to give us the location.

=== Technical decisions
* In the data model of the restapi, we unified the user model with the location model, since the user is always going to have the latest location available.
* When dealing with the api in the restapi, we could just omit the controller part working directly in the api part thanks to the solid-node-client. This way, we would be able to let the webapp and the mobile app (not longer in production) working directly with the pods that this layer provides.
* To manage locations, we just use longitude and latitude in order to track the user and it's closest friend.
* First, we were planning to use geolib to find the nearest friend, but finally we just calculated it directly by taking it's coordinates and returning its closest friend.
* We mainly developed the webapp part as the mobile was having troubles with the login part, so we've put the effort by just putting the webapp to work well.

=== Internationalization
From the popular point of view of every application (and specifically for this one which deals with locations and people), it looks like as if it was mandatory to produce a well based multi-language application, and the best option is always at the beginning of the design.

Otherwise, during it's lifetime it would be much more expensive to trace if the app gets popular in more regions.

=== Notifications
An important element of the app is to know if the friends are near us. To do this we implemented a notification system. A user gets a notification when a user is near.
As we implemented this the app is searching for the nearest user and sending a notification to the user so they know they are near. 
The notification contains the webId of the user that is closest to us so we know who is that person.

=== Testing
We considered the testing of the application very important, and as such we performed the following tests to ensure the correct functioning of our application and to solve any errors that could arise:

* Unit testing:
performed by checking that every component of the application works isolated. This is done by only rendering itself without the rest of the components. To achieve this we implemented one test per component in the application, rendering it and making some assertions about it. In this case, the most difficult parts we found were to learn the assertions the react testing library provides and also how to mock different properties of these components,
which were all new concepts to the developer team and as such had a steep learning curve.

* E2E testing:
This approach is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. The main goal in this case was to increase the usability of the web application by testing the main scenarios that an average user could face, such as:
Registering and getting a pod from Solid Community or Inrupt by going to each provider's dedicated page.

** Performing the login action.
** Ensuring that the translation is well implemented across the different sections of the application.
** Navigational consistency by interacting with the different views the application offers to the users.

* Load testing: in this case what we want to measure is the performance of the webapp when a certain number of users are interacting with it.
In our case we measured three different scenarios which we consider to be a good showcase of what the application can do.

** We perform login and add a new location to the POD from the location view.
** We perform login and delete the newest location saved in the map view.
** We navigate through all the sections of the webapp to interact with all the functionalities offered.

The number of concurrent users we use for the first two cases is 2 constant users added each two seconds for 30 seconds.
In the case of the general navigation load test, since the operations are loading components and getting basic information from the POD, and those actions are the most common among users when they are logged in the app, we increased the number of constant users added to 5 in order to get a more realistic view of the performance.
