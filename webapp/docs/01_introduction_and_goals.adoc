== Introduction and Goals
This document is a description of the work done during the course of Software Architecture in the University of Oviedo. The aim of the course is to create an application called Radarin. The purpose of it is to facilitate meeting between friends using new technologies managing the information of the users in a decentralized way using the SOLID project. The information of the user will only be able to be used if the user give us permission to do so.

The members of our team are:

* Irene Bello
* Sergio Riestra
* Sergio Fernández
* Raúl Núñez García
* Armando Campa Martínez
* Francisco Manuel Fernández Suárez

=== Requirements Overview

The two main requirements are:

* building a Web application that will run in a server and will store locations in a decentralized way.
* building an application that will run in a mobile phone speaking to the server and receiving notifications when friends in the app are near.

The other requirements the application will have are:

* The application will store the minimal information about a user; the rest will be on a user pod.
* The system will be deployed from docker containers and in a cloud service
* The web application will contain some monitoring system.
* It is required to develop unit tests, acceptances test and load test.

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Priority|Goal|Description
| 1 | Usability | The final application should be easy to use for the first time for new users. This means that a normal user with no experience with this application could work without any problems with it.
| 2 | Security | The application will not lead to any security problems. It will not store personal information about the user, it will ask permission to access this information.
| 3 | Efficiency | The final application should work with small waiting times and doing its functionality without any error.
| 4 | Availability | The application has to be accesible for the user 24/7. There are not time frames where the application will not work.
| 5 | Testability | The app will be tested so we know that it behaves as it should and have the minimal unsuspected errors.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Teacher | Teachers of the Software Architecture course | Oversee the project and check that the requirements are met. Help with the application giving us tips of how to make hour app better for the final user.
| Developer team | The ones developing the app | Make an usable application and learn about software architecture. Furthermore, as we are working in teams it will also teach us how to work in them.
| End Users | People that use the final application | They want a funcitonal application that is easy to use, that does not use information unless they want to.
| Administrators | Users that have admin priviledges | They will manage the users and other data throught the web application.
| SOLID comunity | People of the solid comunity that works with it daily | They are a group of people working with SOLID that are interested in making the product better. They could find errors in the code and help us via the forum when we are developing the application.
