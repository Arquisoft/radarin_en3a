== System Scope and Context
Radarin is an app that let's the user know in real time when and where another friend is near by being both notified in their smartphones.

This way, two user friends can chat through the app, maybe meet and share experiences together.

It also allows the user to see multimedia content from the places their friends posted, being able to interact with those publications.

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context
The following diagram describes the main use case from the user point of view and the ways the information traverses the main services of the application.

.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.
****

The *User* sends information to the application, and once it finds a close *friend*, both are notified that they are close to each other, so they have the chance to interact and (perhaps) meet.

The messages, images, videos and generally the rest of the media they share will be managed by the *solid pod*, in which every user will have a decentralized and individual data storage attached, so they can modify or eliminate everything putting always the security information as the first priority by controlling undesirable accesses.

The minimum information consists of the location and the time stamp, leaving the rest of the data like images, chats, videos, etc to be securely at the pod, where the *application* communicates to let other users see certain parts like messages or multimedia content that the actual owner of an account has as public to let them watch.

=== Technical Context

For this app, we are using the solid pods to store information about each of the users so they can later access to add or modify their data once authenticated, JavaScript using React libarary to develop the user interface

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
