== System Scope and Context
Radarin is an app that let's the user know in real time when and where another friend is near by being both notified in their smartphones.

This way, two user friends can meet and share their experiences together.

It also allows the user to see it's location history to track the visited places.

=== Business Context
The following diagram describes the main use case from the user point of view and the ways the information traverses the main services of the application.

The *User* sends information to the application, and once it finds a close *friend*, both are notified that they are close to each other, so they have the chance to interact and (perhaps) meet.

The data of the user will be managed by the *solid pod*, in which every user will have a decentralized and individual data storage attached, so they can modify or eliminate everything putting always the security information as the first priority by controlling undesirable accesses.

The minimum information consists of the location and the time stamp, leaving the rest of the data to be securely at the pod, where the *application* communicates to let other users see certain parts like messages or multimedia content that the actual owner of an account has as public to let them watch.

=== Technical Context

For this app, we are using the solid pods to store information about each of the users so they can later access to add or modify their data once authenticated, JavaScript using React libarary to develop the user interfaces for the web and the mobile application.
