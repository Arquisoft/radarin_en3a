== Building Block View

.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

=== Whitebox Overall System

_**Overview Diagram**_

image:05_building_blocks-EN_1.png["Overview Diagram"]

Motivation::

The general structure of the system is an application, where users can know that there are friends near them that are stored in their PODs.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| User | Interacts with the application
| Radarin's apps | It's the application. Contains all the functionalities
| Web server | Recieves all the requests and returns the information provided by the PODs
| POD provider | Provides all the PODs of our users
| User POD | One for each user. Provides all the information
| APIs | The ones we use to show the routes in the map
|===

=== Level 2 

Motivation::

Show the decomposition of the Application in the relevant parts of the main part of the system.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Interface layer | It is composed by 2 nav bars offering different options like the profile, a map view, a list of your locations and a list of friends.

|Data access layer | It sends and replies the needed information from the PODs and MongoDB.

|Notifications | It notifies that there are a nearby friend.

|Components | JavaScript components created by React that are used like building blocks of code.

|Tests | Tests included in the web application to ensure the proper functioning of the React components (folder not yet).

|Css | Style worksheets that are used to style the application.
