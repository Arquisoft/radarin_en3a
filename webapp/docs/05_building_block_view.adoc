== Building Block View

.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

Motivation::

The general structure of the system is an application, where users can know that there are friends near them that are stored in their PODs.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| User | Interacts with the application
| Radarin's apps | It's the application. Contains all the functionalities
| Web server | Recieves all the requests and returns the information provided by the PODs
| POD provider | Provides all the PODs of our users
| User POD | One for each user. Provides all the information
| APIs | The ones we use to show the routes in the map

This part will be done as the project progresses and decisions are taken in due time.
