|Prior|Risk/Debt|Consequence| Suggested Solution
| 1 | New technology |The most important debt is the tecnologies proposed, as both SOLID and React are new to us. | Read and obtain information about them to obtain the ability to program with them.
| 2 | Working as a team |A possible lack of coordination, due to our inexperience as a working group. | The comunication and the use of tools like github issues to improve as a team.
| 3 | Lack of time |Time management migth also be hard as we can not be 100% devoted to the project. | Organize our schedules and plan the work to be done is the best solution
| 4 | Bad interaction with the app | Non-technical users will interact with it is important to make a good product. | Make a clean application were all the interactive things had a clear intention.
| 5 | Poor performance of the application | The application may receive a lot of requests at the same time. | It is necessary to apply techniques that increase effectively the performance of the application.
| 6 | The real geolocalization of the user | We cannot know if the GPS of our device return the exact position. | Try to return the exact position with the minimum error, checking it in different devices.
