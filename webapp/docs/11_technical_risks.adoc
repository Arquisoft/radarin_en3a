|Prior|Risk/Debt|Consequence| Suggested Solution
| 1 | New technology |The most important debt is the tecnologies proposed, as both SOLID and React are new to us. | Read and obtain information about them to obtain the ability to program with them.
| 2 | Working as a team |A possible lack of coordination, due to our inexperience as a working group. | The comunication and the use of tools like github issues to improve as a team.
| 3 | Lack of time |Time management migth also be hard as we can not be 100% devoted to the project.| Organize our schedules and plan the work to be done is the best solution

These are the initial risks/debts we can have, probably in the future, we must include another one.
