== Deployment View

=== Overview

In this case the deployment view will be different depending on the stage the project is in. For the development and testing the environment will be hosted locally by each student, but for the production phase,
the project will be deployed on a Docker container and hosted on Heroku. Below you can find a deployment diagram showing the mapping of the different building blocks of the system to its infrastructure during the production stage.
